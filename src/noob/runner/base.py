    Call an async function synchronously, either in this thread or a subthread.

    So here's the deal with this nonsense:

    * Calling async from sync is easy when there is no running eventloop in the thread
    * Calling async from sync is **almost comically hard** when there is a running eventloop.

    We are likely to encounter the second case where, e.g.,
    some async application calls some other code that uses a :class:`.SyncRunner`
    to run a tube that has an async node.

    :func:`asyncio.run` and :class:`asyncio.Runner` refuse to run when there is live eventloop,
    and attempting to use any of the :class:`~asyncio.Task` or :class:`~asyncio.Future`
    spawning methods from the running eventloop like :meth:`~asyncio.AbstractEventLoop.call_soon`
    or :func:`asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`
    and then polling for the result with :meth:`asyncio.Future.result`
    causes a deadlock between the outer sync thread and the eventloop.
    The basic problem is that there is no way to wait in the thread (synchronously)
    that yields the thread to the eventloop (which is what async functions are for).

    We need to make a new thread in **some** way,
    Django's ``asgiref`` has a mindblowingly complicated
    `async_to_sync <https://github.com/django/asgiref/blob/2b28409ab83b3e4cf6fed9019403b71f8d7d1c51/asgiref/sync.py#L585>`_
    function that works **roughly** by creating a new thread
    and then calling :func:`asyncio.run` from *within that*
    (plus about a thousand other things to manage all the edge cases).
    That's more than a little bit cursed, because ideally,
    since the hard case here is where there is already an eventloop in the outer thread,
    we would be able to just *use that eventloop*.
    Normally one would just ``await`` the coro directly,
    which is what :class:`.AsyncRunner` does,
    but the :class:`.SyncRunner` can't do that because :meth:`.SyncRunner.process` is sync.

    However if one creates a new thread with a new eventloop,
    that will break any stateful nodes that e.g. have objects like :class:`asyncio.Event`
    that are bound to the first eventloop.

    Until we can figure out how to reuse the outer eventloop,
    we do the best we can with a modified version of ``asgiref`` 's approach.

    * Create a :class:`asyncio.Future` to store the eventual result we will return
      (the "result future")
    * Wrap the coroutine to call in another coroutine that calls :meth:`~asyncio.Future.set_result`
      or :meth:`~asyncio.Future.set_exception` on some passed future
      rather than returning the result directly
    * Use a :class:`~concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to run the wrapped coroutine
      in a **new** :class:`asyncio.AbstractEventLoop` in a separate thread,
      returning a second :class:`~concurrent.futures.Future` (the "completion future")
    * Add a callback to the completion future that notifies a :class:`~threading.Condition`
    * Wait in the main thread for the :class:`~threading.Condition` to be notified
    * Return the result from the result future.

    The reason we don't just directly return the value of the process coroutine
    in the inner wrapper coroutine
    and then return the result of the completion future is error handling -
    Errors raised in the wrapping coroutine have a large amount of noise in the traceback,
    so instead we use :meth:`~asyncio.Future.set_exception` to propagate the raised error
    up to the main thread and raise it there.

    Args:
        fn: The callable that returns a coroutine to run
        executor (concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor | None): Provide an already-created
            thread pool executor. If ``None`` , creates one and shuts it down before returning
        *args: Passed to ``fn``
        **kwargs: Passed to ``fn``

    Returns: The result of the called function
