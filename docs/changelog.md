# Changelog

## v1000.*

### Unreleased

**Added**

- `noob-core` - an optional rust implementation of the scheduler and topo sorter
  (`packages/noob-core`, pyO3 bindings).
  When installed, `noob.scheduler.Scheduler` *is* the rust-backed
  `noob.rust_scheduler.RustScheduler`, a drop-in replacement for the public
  scheduler API - no code changes needed. The pure-python scheduler remains in
  place and is used when `noob-core` is not installed,
  or when `NOOB_SCHEDULER=python` is set.
  The rust `CoreScheduler` owns one `CoreTopoSorter` per epoch; all scheduler
  logic runs in rust, and `Epoch`/`NodeSignal`/`MetaEvent` objects are
  constructed at the barrier, so the python classes are pure delegation.
  ~3x faster epoch scheduling on medium-sized (hundreds of nodes) graphs.

### v1000.1.0 - 26-05-18

**Added**

- [`#195`](https://github.com/miniscope/noob/pull/195),
  [`#196`](https://github.com/miniscope/noob/pull/196) -
  `extends` keyword - allow a tube to extend other tubes!
  reuse tubes, add on new nodes, override them, and so on.
  build bigger tubes out of smaller tube fragments.
- [`#196`](https://github.com/miniscope/noob/pull/196) -
  `NoEventable[]` convenience generic that indicates that a return type can also be NoEvent.
- [`#207`](https://github.com/miniscope/noob/pull/207),
  [`#209`](https://github.com/miniscope/noob/pull/209),
  [`#214`](https://github.com/miniscope/noob/pull/214),
  [`#222`](https://github.com/miniscope/noob/pull/222) - 
  Big improvements to the display of tubes. 
  A `noob view` cli command to show a live-updating display of a tube as it is edited on disk.
  Better representations of tube specs: nested tubes, correct signals and slots from inspecting nodes,
  better use of the ELK layout engine.

**Changed**

- [`#211`](https://github.com/miniscope/noob/pull/211) - 
  Allow accessing a node's signals and slots from a classmethod,
  avoids needing to instantiate a node in order to inspect its edge properties
- [`#212`](https://github.com/miniscope/noob/pull/212) - 
  Make the `signals` and `slots` accessors have the same type: dicts rather than dicts and lists
- [`#213`](https://github.com/miniscope/noob/pull/213) - 
  An additional `NodeInfo` dictionary contains metadata about signals and slots
  derived from the combination of the node specification and the node class.

### v1000.0.1 - 26-03-15

**Fix**
- [#192](https://github.com/miniscope/noob/issues/192), 
  [#201](https://github.com/miniscope/noob/issues/201),
  [#202](https://github.com/miniscope/noob/pull/202) - 
  Support event values that can't use the `==` operator by using `is` to check for NoEvents
